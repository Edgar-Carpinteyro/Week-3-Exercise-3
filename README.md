# Week-3-Exercise-3
## Objective

### Add the remaining comparison operations (>, <, !=)

* For every other comparison operator, ensure your JavaScript logic returns a true statement.
  - Example: If your first operand is 3 and the second is 2, while your comparison operator is >, your HTML should tell the user both operandsâ€™ data types and if their values match the logic (is 3 > 2?).
